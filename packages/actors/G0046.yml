comments: '[FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046) is a financially-motivated
  threat group that has been active since 2013 primarily targeting the U.S. retail,
  restaurant, and hospitality sectors, often using point-of-sale malware. A portion
  of [FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046) was run out of a front company
  called Combi Security. Since 2020 [FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046)
  shifted operations to a big game hunting (BGH) approach including use of [REvil](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0496)
  ransomware and their own Ransomware as a Service (RaaS), Darkside. [FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046)
  may be linked to the [Carbanak](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0008) Group, but
  there appears to be several groups using [Carbanak](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0030)
  malware and are therefore tracked separately.(Citation: FireEye FIN7 March 2017)(Citation:
