comments: '[Axiom](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0001) is a cyber espionage group
  suspected to be associated with the Chinese government. It is responsible for the
  Operation SMN campaign. (Citation: Novetta-Axiom) Though both this group and [Winnti
  Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0044) use the malware [Winnti for Windows](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0141),
  the two groups appear to be distinct based on differences in reporting on the groups''
  TTPs and targeting. (Citation: Kaspersky Winnti April 2013) (Citation: Kaspersky
