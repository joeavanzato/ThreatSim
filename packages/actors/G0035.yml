comments: '[Dragonfly](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0035) is a cyber espionage
  group that has been active since at least 2011. They initially targeted defense
  and aviation companies but shifted to focus to include the energy sector in early
  2013. They have also targeted companies related to industrial control systems. (Citation:

  A similar group emerged in 2015 and was identified by Symantec as [Dragonfly 2.0](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0074).
  There is debate over the extent of the overlap between [Dragonfly](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0035)
  and [Dragonfly 2.0](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0074), but there is sufficient
  evidence to lead to these being tracked as two separate groups. (Citation: Symantec
