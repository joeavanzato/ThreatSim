comments: '[Cobalt Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0080) is a financially
  motivated threat group that has primarily targeted financial institutions since
  at least 2016. The group has conducted intrusions to steal money via targeting ATM
  systems, card processing, payment systems and SWIFT systems. [Cobalt Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0080)
  has mainly targeted banks in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia. One
  of the alleged leaders was arrested in Spain in early 2018, but the group still
  appears to be active. The group has been known to target organizations in order
  to use their access to then compromise additional victims.(Citation: Talos Cobalt
