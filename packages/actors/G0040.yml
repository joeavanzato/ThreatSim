comments: '[Patchwork](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0040) is a cyberespionage
  group that was first observed in December 2015. While the group has not been definitively
  attributed, circumstantial evidence suggests the group may be a pro-Indian or Indian
  entity. [Patchwork](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0040) has been seen targeting
  industries related to diplomatic and government agencies. Much of the code used
  by this group was copied and pasted from online forums. [Patchwork](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0040)
  was also seen operating spearphishing campaigns targeting U.S. think tank groups
  in March and April of 2018. (Citation: Cymmetria Patchwork) (Citation: Symantec
