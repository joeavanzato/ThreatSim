comments: '[OilRig](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0049) is a suspected Iranian
  threat group that has targeted Middle Eastern and international victims since at
  least 2014. The group has targeted a variety of sectors, including financial, government,
  energy, chemical, and telecommunications. It appears the group carries out supply
  chain attacks, leveraging the trust relationship between organizations to attack
  their primary targets. FireEye assesses that the group works on behalf of the Iranian
  government based on infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use
  of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests.
