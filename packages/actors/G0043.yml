comments: '[Group5](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0043) is a threat group with
  a suspected Iranian nexus, though this attribution is not definite. The group has
  targeted individuals connected to the Syrian opposition via spearphishing and watering
  holes, normally using Syrian and Iranian themes. [Group5](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0043)
  has used two commonly available remote access tools (RATs), [njRAT](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0385)
  and [NanoCore](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0336), as well as an Android RAT,
  DroidJack. (Citation: Citizen Lab Group5)'
