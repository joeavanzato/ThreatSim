comments: '[Rocke](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0106) is an alleged Chinese-speaking
  adversary whose primary objective appeared to be cryptojacking, or stealing victim
  system resources for the purposes of mining cryptocurrency. The name [Rocke](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0106)
  comes from the email address "rocke@live.cn" used to create the wallet which held
  collected cryptocurrency. Researchers have detected overlaps between [Rocke](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0106)
  and the Iron Cybercrime Group, though this attribution has not been confirmed.(Citation:
