comments: '[Stealth Falcon](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0038) is a threat group
  that has conducted targeted spyware attacks against Emirati journalists, activists,
  and dissidents since at least 2012. Circumstantial evidence suggests there could
  be a link between this group and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government, but
  that has not been confirmed. (Citation: Citizen Lab Stealth Falcon May 2016)'
