comments: '[Scarlet Mimic](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0029) is a threat group
  that has targeted minority rights activists. This group has not been directly linked
  to a government source, but the group''s motivations appear to overlap with those
  of the Chinese government. While there is some overlap between IP addresses used
  by [Scarlet Mimic](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0029) and [Putter Panda](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0024),
  it has not been concluded that the groups are the same. (Citation: Scarlet Mimic
