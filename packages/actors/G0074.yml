comments: '[Dragonfly 2.0](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0074) is a suspected Russian
  group that has targeted government entities and multiple U.S. critical infrastructure
  sectors since at least December 2015. (Citation: US-CERT TA18-074A) (Citation: Symantec
  Dragonfly Sept 2017) There is debate over the extent of overlap between [Dragonfly
  2.0](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0074) and [Dragonfly](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0035),
  but there is sufficient evidence to lead to these being tracked as two separate
  groups. (Citation: Fortune Dragonfly 2.0 Sept 2017)(Citation: Dragos DYMALLOY )'
