  threat group known to target many industries, including government, defense, financial,
  and telecommunications. (Citation: Alperovitch 2014) The intrusion into healthcare
  company Anthem has been attributed to [Deep Panda](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0009).
  (Citation: ThreatConnect Anthem) This group is also known as Shell Crew, WebMasters,
  KungFu Kittens, and PinkPanther. (Citation: RSA Shell Crew) [Deep Panda](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0009)
  also appears to be known as Black Vine based on the attribution of both group names
  to the Anthem intrusion. (Citation: Symantec Black Vine) Some analysts track [Deep
  Panda](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0009) and [APT19](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0073)
  as the same group, but it is unclear from open source information if the groups
